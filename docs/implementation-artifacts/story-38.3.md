# Story 38.3: FSRS State Initialization Guarantee

## Story

As a learner,
I want the review priority calculation to always use real FSRS data when available,
So that my review schedule is truly personalized, not falling back to a fixed score.

## Status

review

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-1 (D3: Input Validation — Non-null Guarantee)**
- Given a review item is requested for the dashboard
- When the backend queries FSRS state for a concept
- Then if a valid FSRS card exists, `fsrs_state` is returned with all fields non-null
- And if no FSRS card exists, the response is `{found: false, reason: "no_card_created"}`
- And if `_fsrs_manager` is None, the response is `{found: false, reason: "fsrs_not_initialized"}`

**AC-2 (D3: Input Validation — Frontend Contract)**
- Given the frontend receives a review item with `fsrs_state: null`
- When `calculatePriority()` is called
- Then the FSRS dimension uses a default score of 50 (existing behavior — validated as correct)
- And the UI shows an indicator: "FSRS data unavailable" next to the priority score
- And the `reason` field from the backend is logged to console for debugging

**AC-3 (D5: Degradation — FSRS Manager Initialization)**
- Given the application starts
- When `ReviewService` initializes `_fsrs_manager`
- Then if initialization succeeds, log: `"FSRS manager initialized successfully"`
- And if initialization fails, log WARNING: `"FSRS manager failed to initialize: {reason}"`
- And the `/health` endpoint includes `fsrs: "ok"` or `fsrs: "degraded"`

**AC-4 (D4: Configuration — Auto Card Creation)**
- Given a concept enters the review system for the first time
- When no FSRS card exists for this concept
- Then a default FSRS card is automatically created (stability=1.0, difficulty=5.0, state=New)
- And subsequent queries for this concept return `{found: true}` with real data

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: AC-1 — Backend `get_fsrs_state()` returns structured reason codes
  - [x] 1.1: Modify `ReviewService.get_fsrs_state()` to return `reason` field
  - [x] 1.2: Update API endpoint `FSRSStateQueryResponse` to include `reason` field
- [x] Task 2: AC-3 — FSRS Manager initialization logging + health endpoint
  - [x] 2.1: Enhance `ReviewService.__init__` logging for FSRS init success/failure
  - [x] 2.2: Add `fsrs` field to `/health` endpoint response
- [x] Task 3: AC-4 — Auto card creation on first FSRS state query
  - [x] 3.1: When `get_fsrs_state()` finds no card, auto-create default FSRS card
  - [x] 3.2: Persist auto-created card to cache and return real state
- [x] Task 4: AC-2 — Frontend indicator for FSRS data unavailable
  - [x] 4.1: Pass `reason` through to PriorityResult in frontend
  - [x] 4.2: Add UI indicator in ReviewDashboardView
  - [x] 4.3: Log `reason` to console for debugging
- [x] Task 5: Write tests and validate all ACs
  - [x] 5.1: Unit tests for `get_fsrs_state()` reason codes (3 tests)
  - [x] 5.2: Unit tests for auto card creation (3 tests)
  - [x] 5.3: Unit tests for health endpoint FSRS field (2 tests)
  - [x] 5.4: Run full regression suite (1155 passed, 25 pre-existing failures in unrelated test_story_31a2)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture
- `ReviewService.get_fsrs_state()` in `backend/app/services/review_service.py:L1693-1768`
- API endpoint in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/review.py:L985-1045`
- Frontend priority calc: `PriorityCalculatorService.ts:L281-287`
- Frontend query: `TodayReviewListService.ts:L714-768`
- Health endpoint: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/health.py`

### Key Findings from Code Exploration
1. `get_fsrs_state()` currently returns generic `{"found": False}` for both "no card" and "FSRS not initialized"
2. Auto card creation already exists in `record_review_result()` (L737-740) but NOT in `get_fsrs_state()` query path
3. AC-4 is the root fix: create cards on query, not just on review recording
4. Health endpoint has no FSRS status reporting
5. Frontend already handles `null` FSRS with score=50, but no UI indicator or reason logging

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Plan
- Task 1: Add `reason` field to backend responses
- Task 2: Add FSRS health reporting
- Task 3: Auto-create FSRS cards on query (key fix)
- Task 4: Frontend indicator changes
- Task 5: Tests

### Debug Log
- Fixed pre-existing f-string bug in `get_fsrs_state()` debug log: `f"{retrievability:.3f if retrievability else 'N/A'}"` → `f"{f'{retrievability:.3f}' if retrievability is not None else 'N/A'}"`

### Completion Notes
- AC-1: `get_fsrs_state()` now returns `reason` field: `"fsrs_not_initialized"`, `"no_card_created"`, or `"error: ..."`. API endpoint passes through via `FSRSStateQueryResponse.reason`.
- AC-2: Frontend `PriorityResult` carries `fsrsUnavailable` flag. `TodayReviewItem` passes it to dashboard. `ReviewDashboardView` shows "FSRS data unavailable" badge. `TodayReviewListService` logs reason to console.
- AC-3: `ReviewService.__init__` now tracks `_fsrs_init_ok` and `_fsrs_init_reason`. Logs "FSRS manager initialized successfully" or "FSRS manager failed to initialize: {reason}". `/health` endpoint returns `components.fsrs: "ok"` or `"degraded"`.
- AC-4: `get_fsrs_state()` now auto-creates default FSRS card when none exists, caches it, and returns `found: true` with real data. Subsequent queries hit the cache.
- Bonus: Fixed pre-existing f-string format bug in debug logging.
- Test results: 14/14 new tests pass. 20/20 existing FSRS tests pass. 1155/1180 unit tests pass (25 pre-existing failures in unrelated file).
