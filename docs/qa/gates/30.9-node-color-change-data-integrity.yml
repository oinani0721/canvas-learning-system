# Issues resolved from Story 30.6 CONCERNS gate
resolved_issues:
  - id: "DATA-001"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "initializeState() pre-populates previousCanvasState by scanning all .canvas files before registering vault.on('modify'). 5s timeout prevents startup blocking."
    verified_by: "T1, T2, timeout test (unit); preload test (integration)"

  - id: "DATA-002"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "detectColorChanges() now detects color removal via allNodeIds check. Emits color_removed event with newColor:null, newLevel:null."
    verified_by: "T3, T4, T7 (unit); color removal integration test"

  - id: "DATA-003"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "Frontend adds concept field to metadata. Backend uses concept → node_text → 'unknown' fallback chain."
    verified_by: "T5, fallback test (unit); concept integration test; 3 backend tests"

  - id: "DATA-004"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "detectColorChanges() detects node deletion via !allNodeIds.has(nodeId). Emits node_removed event."
    verified_by: "T6, T7 (unit); node deletion integration test"

  - id: "TYPE-001"
    original_severity: low
    resolution: "CanvasEventType enum extended with COLOR_CHANGED, COLOR_REMOVED, NODE_REMOVED values."
    verified_by: "Backend event type tests"

  - id: "BATCH-001"
    original_severity: low
    resolution: "flushChanges() chunks events into groups of 50 with independent timeout per chunk."
    verified_by: "T8 (120 events → 3 batches), single batch test"

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No sensitive data exposure, local API only"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Startup scan with 5s timeout cap. Batch chunking at 50 events. No runtime overhead increase."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All event types tracked (color change, removal, node deletion). Silent degradation maintained per ADR-0004."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean TypeScript types with ColorChangeEventType union. Frontend/backend field mapping aligned. Source comments reference story/AC numbers."

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Store nodeText in previousCanvasState alongside color so node_removed events carry concept name instead of 'unknown'"
      refs: ["canvas-progress-tracker/obsidian-plugin/src/services/NodeColorChangeWatcher.ts:162"]
    - action: "Add cancellation to scanAllCanvasFiles() on timeout to prevent background state mutation after event listener registration"

# ADR compliance

  - adr: "ADR-0003"
    title: "Graphiti Memory Architecture"
