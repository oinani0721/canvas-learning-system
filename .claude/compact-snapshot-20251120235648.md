# Context Snapshot Before Compression

**Trigger**: auto

## Current BMad Status

**Active Agent**: none
**Executing Function**: Implementing features
**Core Content**:
**Current Epic/Story**: Epic 11, Story 5.

**Relevant Files**:
- `C:\Users\ROG\托福\Canvas\docs\PROJECT_DELIVERY_INVENTORY.md`

**Next Actions**:
- 鈴?Verify PowerShell transcript parsing works correctly
- 鈴?Test fifth /compact with automated snapshot fill
- 鈴?Update COMPRESSION_WORKAROUND_README.md with real solution

**Key Technical Decisions**:
1. **PowerShell reads transcript_path directly**: PreCompact hook receives transcript_path via stdin, reads JSONL file, and extracts conversation history automatically. (Rejected: Waiting for Claude to fill snapshot - timing issue discovered)
2. **Snapshot filled immediately by PowerShell**: No dependency on Claude, no timing issues. PowerShell completes all work before compression executes. (Rejected: SNAPSHOT_FILL_INSTRUCTION approach - compression executes too fast)
3. **JSONL parsing in PowerShell**: Parse each line as JSON, extract user/assistant messages, build conversation history array. (Rejected: Complex regex parsing)

## Last 20 Conversation Turns

### Turn 1: User

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all essential details:

## Message 1: System Reminders (Context Reload)
The conversation starts after a context compression. The system provided:
1. Result of reading `docs/archive/graphrag-deprecated/README.md` - confirming GraphRAG files were archived due to SCP-005 decision
2. A todo list showing 4 tasks
3. Extensive context reload via SessionStart hook including:
   - Full CLAUDE.md content (81,752 chars)
   - Pre-compression snapshot
   - Canvas project status in YAML format
   - BMad Phase 4: Implementation status

## Message 2: Continuation Request from Previous Session
The system provided a detailed summary showing:
1. User's original request: Deep analysis ("ultrathink") of Canvas Learning System migration project
2. Goals: Create deliverable inventory, development checklist aligned with BMad workflow
3. User's clarification answers:
   - GraphRAG: "归档删除" (archive/delete)
   - Development start: "Epic 11 (FastAPI)"
   - LanceDB migration: "尚未开始" (not started)
   - Scope: "完整路线图" (complete roadmap)
4. A 14-week development roadmap was planned and approved
5. Previous error with `move` command fixed by using PowerShell
6. Explicit instruction: "Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."

## My Action: Created MIGRATION-DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md
Based on the todo list showing task 2 "创建MIGRATION-DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md开发路线图" as in_progress, I:
1. Created the complete 14-week development roadmap document
2. Included all 6 phases with Epic/Story breakdowns
3. Added acceptance criteria, risk management, BMad workflow checkpoints
4. Document successfully created at `C:\Users\ROG\托福\Canvas\docs\MIGRATION-DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md`
